Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int base , exponential;
	cin>>base>>exponential;
	int pow = 1;
	while(exponential!=0){
		pow = pow*base;
		exponential--;
		
	}
	cout<<pow;
}
